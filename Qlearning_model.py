# This reward function assigns a positive reward for actions that result in promoting a checker to a king or capturing an enemy checker, and a negative reward for actions that result in promoting an enemy checker to a king. It also assigns a small positive reward for moving to an empty space on the board. You can modify this function to suit the specific requirements of your implementation. For example, you may want to assign different rewards for different types of captures or for other types of actions that affect the game.



# Create a Q-learning learner

# Train the learner for 1000 iterations
learner.learn(1000)

  # Check if the game is over
  if reward == 10 or reward == -10:
    # The game is over if a player has won or the board is full
    break

# This code creates a Q-learning learner, trains it for 1000 iterations, and then uses it to play a game of checkers. The learner selects the best action for the current state using the get_best_action() method, and executes the action by updating the state space and observing the reward. The game is considered over if a player has won or if the board is full. You can modify this code to suit the specific requirements of your implementation. For example, you may want to include additional code to handle the special rules that apply to kings or to implement different strategies for playing the game.
